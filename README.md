    The shell is a program that processes the entered commands and returns an ouput (e.g. Bash). The Terminal is a program that runs a shell 
• What are flags?
    Common way to specify options for command line programs. Typically is a single dash (-) or double dash (--) followed by a letter, number, symbol, or word. An example of this is the “-m” when committing to Github.

Explain and be able to use the following shell commands:
- `cd` → Navigating through a directory (changes directory to specified one)

- `touch` → creates a file in the current directory 

- `ls` → lists the contents of the current working directory. Can be modified by adding an l flag (-l) after ls in order to show the items in long format.

- `pwd` → prints the current working directory of the shell session. Mine is /Users/gracehartzell

- `mkdir` → makes a new directory based from the current directory you’re in

- `rm` → deletes the file entered next to it (e.g. “rm [filename]”, just make sure to not put it in brackets)

- `sudo` → allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.

- `cat` → reading a file
